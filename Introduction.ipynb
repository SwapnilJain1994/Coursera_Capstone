    "\n",
    "##### A large scale business owner, who has a wide scale presence in many cities in USA, wants to start a new business in New Castle county in Delaware, USA. He is already exposed to various types of business setups (eg grocery stores, restaurants, fast food centers etc), but it is his first time he is planning to setup some business in New Castle, Delaware. Even though he has some business ideas floating in his mind, he thinks now it's the time to balance it with a little reality. Does those ideas have the potential to succeed?  Well he realizes the need to run his business ideas through a validation process before he go any further and take a final call.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### In order for the business to be successful, it must solve a problem, fulfill a need or offer something the market wants. There are a number of ways we can identify this need, may be  research, focus groups, and even trial and error etc.\n",

Location selection of the place of the  business is equally important along with the type of business for the smooth operation of the business. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Once the solution is figured out regarding the suitable location and type of business, he may possibly need to extend his thinking to find out whether his business can deliver something other companies don't (or deliver the same thing, only faster and cheaper).\n",
    "\n",
